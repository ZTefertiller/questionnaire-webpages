Here are a few files for the questionnaires and other forms ie demographics / consent for online tasks in the lab. 

For prolific integration:
  1) make sure that prolificLinks.js is configured with specific links from Prolific for your particular study 
  2) the first component of your study on JATOS needs to be the prolificLanding.html 
  3) the second component of your study should be the participant code generator
  4) make sure you record the participant code with the data for any components you have - see questionnaires for how to call it from JATOS
  5) you MUST include an abort study button in your own task pages - you can borrow the CSS in a questionnaire and functionality from     prolificLinks.js
  6) the consent form here needs to be updated for your specific study if you would like to use it as a template
  7) most importantly - DO NOT record prolific IDs in your task script or in questionnaires. they must be used to track bonuses and consent,       nothing else.

If you need help with any of this email or send a teams message to Zach.
